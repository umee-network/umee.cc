Umeemania is here and the community is buzzing! To onboard as many Umee users as possible, we want to make sure we have plenty of educational materials available.

**TL; DR**

Create a testnet tutorial video or extended gif that **showcases how to do one (or more) tasks/requirements for Umeemania**. Share it on Twitter using **#MyUmeeTutorial** and tagging **[@Umee_CrossChain](https://twitter.com/Umee_CrossChain)** by April 25, 2022 @ 15:00 UTC for a chance to win Umee tokens!

Weâ€™ve seen the community rally around Umeemania and excitedly try out our native lending module. But, for Umee to reach as many as possible, we need your help to inform the broader community what theyâ€™re missing out on!

We want you to provide insight and guidance about the current testnet to potential and existing community members by creating testnet tutorial video or extended gif that **showcases how to do one (or more) tasks/requirements of Umeemania**. You can create guides/tutorials that feature yourself on camera, screen recording with voice over, screen recording with overlaid text, or a mixture of them all. Here are some ideas to create your tutorials on: 

- How to best increase TVL 
- How to procure testnet tokens 
- How to switch from main networks to test networks in wallets 
- Testnet Web App User Flow
- How to perform an IBC transfer 
- How to borrow assets
- How to lend assets 
- And anything else you think users need to know!  

**Winners will be selected by the Umee team based on:**
- Clarity
- Conciseness
- Easiness to Follow
